                        <h3>My name is, Celia Bellido Jones<br> and I want you to experience Lima from the point of view of a local.</h3>
                        <p>I am a Peruana. I was born in Peru and have spent my entire life living here in Lima. My native language in Spanish, but I am also fluent in English.
                             Now, although I was born, raised and grew up here in Lima, I have seen much of the world and have had the privilege of experiencing many different 
                             cultures. And the more that I travelled and learnt, the more I have come to appreciate just how unique Lima truly is. <br> During my own travels, I always
                              enjoyed being shown around in a manner in which you would show an old friend, and I want you to experience Lima in the same fashion. I believe that 
                            everybody should be able to experience and enjoy Lima just as much as myself. It is my goal that with my help, you will love your time here and recommend
                             this great city to the rest of the world. </p>
